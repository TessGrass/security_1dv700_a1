it's beginning to look a lot like christmas
everywhere you go
take a look at the five and ten, it's glistening once again
with candy canes and silver lanes that glow
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas
toys in every store
but the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
on your own front door
a pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
is the wish of barney and ben
dolls that'll talk and will go for a walk
is the hope of janice and jen
and mom and dad can hardly wait for school to start again
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas
everywhere you go
there's a tree in the grand hotel, one in the park as well
it's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas
soon the bells will start
and the thing that'll make 'em ring is the carol that you sing
right within your heart
it's beginning to look a lot like christmas
toys in every store
but the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
on your own front door
sure, it's christmas once more
